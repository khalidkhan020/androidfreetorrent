\t To start downloading a torrent, navigate to the .torrent file on your SD card and click on it. \n\n\t For best results, download torrents one at a time, and at times where you will not use your phone for other tasks. A big, busy torrent can use up a lot of your phone\'s processing power and battery very quickly.\n\n
